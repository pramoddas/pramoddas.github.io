While Project management manuals/books guide you through this topic, what I found fascinating; coming from a technical background, is the relatedness of these two activities(development and management).I am just noting them down as my observations, for future reference. I have been as a Project manager for small scale projects and so I appreciate the fact that more rigour would need to be put in, for large projects

1. It's all about Intuition:
Solving complex problems needs more of intutive ability developed through prior experience(or learned from other person's experiences). You follow your instincts to arrive at a possible set of solutions to a problem. I have seen people with varying degrees of instinctive flexibilities. I will expand on this in different posts and link it back here(including how to nurture your instincts....eg books, podcasts, blogs etc). But I see this as the crucial first step

2. Validating your instinctive solutions:
Whether you are a developer or a manager, you will need to validate your instinctive ideas, be it with a client, or with team mates This helps in narrowing down the set of possible solutions that one can apply to solve the problem.For a developer , it may mean choosing between authentication strategies and for a manager it may mean, re-prioritising the feature  list

3.  External Constraints:
Then after narrowing down the possible set of solutions, time taken, resources etc 

I plan to expand on each of the items in the near future
